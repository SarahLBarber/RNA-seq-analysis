This project undertakes the analysis of RNA-sequencing of untreated mouse mammary tumours and mouse mammary tumours treated with letrozole only, PD-1 antibodies only, and a combination of the two. Mouse mammary tumours were used as a model for ER+ breast cancer to understand the molecular mechanisms behind PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. Differential gene expression analysis was undertaken to compare control and treated mouse mammary tumours to determine how PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors affect tumour gene expression patterns. 
'Differential gene expression analysis' contains all the code for BASH and R studio used in the RNA-seq analysis pipeline of treated mouse mammary tumours including downstream analyses of gene ontology and gene set enrichment analysis. 
'Gao et al (2019) differential gene expression analyssi' contains all code used in the RNA-seq analysis pipeline of human ER+ breast cancers treated with letrozole compared to untreated human ER+ breast cancers from the Gao et al (2019) dataset.
